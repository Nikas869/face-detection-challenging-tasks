# face-detection-challenging-tasks
Comparison of different methods of face detection for difficult situations (Occlusion, scale, illumination etc.)

Dataset: 
[WIDER FACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) divided on categories 
For each category manualy extracted 100 images to train

Compared face detectors:
* [RetinaFace](https://github.com/peteryuX/retinaface-tf2)
* [FaceBoxes](https://github.com/TropComplique/FaceBoxes-tensorflow)

Metrics:
* [mAP](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/map-mean-average-precision-for-object-detection-45c121a31173)
* FPS (ms)
